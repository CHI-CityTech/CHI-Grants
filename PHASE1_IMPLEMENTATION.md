   ```
   - Validates document format and size
   - Generates unique filename with timestamp
   - Extracts basic metadata
   - Registers with workflow manager
   - Moves to PENDING state

2. **AI Extraction Phase**:
   ```bash
   python3 ai_agents/ai_extraction_agent.py --process-all
   ```
   - Transitions documents to PROCESSING state
   - Extracts text from documents
   - Calls OpenAI API for intelligent extraction
   - Generates structured JSON with confidence scores
   - Saves to `workflows/extracted/`
   - Moves documents to EXTRACTED state

3. **Monitoring and Management**:

This document describes how to set up and use GitHub Project Boards for grant tracking.

## Grant Tracking Board

### Board Structure

6. **‚úîÔ∏è Completed** - Finished grants
7. **‚ùå Not Approved** - Declined proposals

### Automation Rules

#### Move to "Under Review"
- **Trigger:** When issue is labeled with `under-review`
- **Action:** Move card to "Under Review" column

#### Move to "Revisions Needed"
- **Trigger:** When issue is labeled with `needs-revision`
- **Action:** Move card to "Revisions Needed" column

#### Move to "Approved"

- **Action:** Move card to "Active" column

#### Move to "Completed"
- **Trigger:** When issue is closed and labeled with `completed`

## Individual Grant Project Boards

For each approved grant, create a dedicated project board with:

### Columns
1. **üìã Backlog** - Planned tasks
2. **üîú Next Up** - Prioritized next tasks
3. **üèÉ In Progress** - Currently active tasks
4. **üëÄ Review** - Tasks awaiting review

### Custom Fields

## Setting Up a New Grant Board

### Manual Setup
1. Go to organization Projects
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Board" template
4. Name it: `[Grant ID] - [Project Name]`
5. Add columns as specified above
6. Configure automation rules

### Using GitHub CLI
```bash
# Create new project board
gh project create "[Grant ID] - [Project Name]" --owner CHI-CityTech

# Add columns (requires project ID from above)
gh project field-create [PROJECT_ID] --name "Priority" --data-type "SINGLE_SELECT" --single-select-options "High,Medium,Low"
```

### Using API/Automation
The grant automation workflow can automatically create and configure project boards when a grant is approved.

## Board Views
